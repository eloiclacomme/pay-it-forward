# pay-it-forward
- Web app to donate and claim unwanted items by neighbors. Add items you no longer want but wish to donate to other members of your community by advertising them on the website. Claim any items you want (first-come first-serve). You will then receive the owner's contact information so you can decide on a time and place to make the exchange.

- The web app has full registration/login functionality, mobile responsiveness, simple animations using Bootstrap (such as the navbar expanding on mobile), REST API calls, integration with database (MongoDB), has authorization functionality (e.g. cannot delete item you do not own), security measures (Mongo injection, Cross Site Scripting), and is deployed.

- 15-20 hours was spent developing this project.
